A Flutter application, visualizing your sports activity data. ![logo](https://github.com/luuuuk/datavisualizationapp/tree/develop/assets/banana_icon.png "Banana Stats Logo")

## Idea

Add your data for four different activity types, see your stats, set goals and follow your progression:

Activities:
- Running
- Cycling
- Climbing
- Hiking

Stats:
- weekly overview
- monthly overview
- 12 weeks overview
- annual overview
- average speed of the last 25 activities in the categories **Running** and **Cycling**

Goals for a specific activity type, for a specific time span and for a specific goal type:
- time span:
  - weekly goals
  - monthly goals
  - annual goals
- goal type:
  - distance
  - time
