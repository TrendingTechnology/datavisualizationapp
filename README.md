## Idea

The data you enter will be saved **only locally**, on the very device you enter it. There is no communication involving your data with any servers, your data will stay in your hands.
Add your data for four different activity types, see your stats, set goals and follow your progression:

Activities:
- Running
- Cycling
- Climbing
- Hiking

Stats:
- weekly overview
- monthly overview
- 12 weeks overview
- annual overview
- average speed of the last 25 activities in the categories **Running** and **Cycling**

Goals for a specific activity type, for a specific time span and for a specific goal type:
- time span:
  - weekly goals
  - monthly goals
  - annual goals
- goal type:
  - distance
  - time
